# Liver Cell Biology Research Group(LIVR)

Brussels Health Campus • Vrije Universiteit Brussel • Brussels • Belgium

---

## Mission
Advance understanding of liver cell diversity, regeneration and fibrosis to drive novel biomarkers, in vitro disease models and therapeutic strategies for chronic liver disorders.

---

## Research Objectives
- **Cellular Characterization**  
  Profile healthy vs. diseased liver cell types at single‑cell resolution.  
- **Fibrosis Mechanisms**  
  Dissect pathways of hepatic stellate cell activation, fibrogenesis and resolution.  
- **Biomarker Discovery**  
  Identify stellate‑cell‑specific markers for non‑invasive fibrosis staging.  
- **Disease Modeling**  
  Build iPSC‑derived liver cell co‑cultures and organoids to recreate MASLD and other chronic conditions.  
- **Regeneration & Progenitors**  
  Elucidate the role of liver progenitor cells in tissue repair.

---

## Key Collaborations & Networks
- **ImAgE‑D** (Marie Skłodowska‑Curie ITN, Oct 2023 – Sep 2027)  
  High‑speed, super‑resolution imaging of endothelial and liver cells.  
- **DeLIVERy** (EIC Pathfinder, May 2022 – Apr 2026)  
  Personalized polypharmacy testing on patient‑derived mini‑livers.
